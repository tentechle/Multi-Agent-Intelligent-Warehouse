## Executive Summary

The Warehouse Operational Assistant implements a comprehensive **Advanced Reasoning Engine** with 5 distinct reasoning types. **The reasoning engine is now fully integrated with ALL agents** (Equipment, Operations, Safety, Forecasting, Document) and the main chat router. Reasoning can be enabled/disabled via the chat API and UI, and reasoning chains are displayed in the chat interface.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented

1. **Reasoning Engine Core** (`src/api/services/reasoning/reasoning_engine.py`)
   - Complete implementation with all 5 reasoning types
   - 954 lines of code
   - Fully functional with NVIDIA NIM LLM integration

2. **Reasoning API Endpoints** (`src/api/routers/reasoning.py`)
   - `/api/v1/reasoning/analyze` - Direct reasoning analysis
   - `/api/v1/reasoning/chat-with-reasoning` - Chat with reasoning
   - `/api/v1/reasoning/insights/{session_id}` - Session insights
   - `/api/v1/reasoning/types` - Available reasoning types

3. **Main Chat Router Integration** (`src/api/routers/chat.py`)
   - ✅ Fully integrated with reasoning engine
   - ✅ Supports `enable_reasoning` and `reasoning_types` parameters
   - ✅ Extracts and includes reasoning chains in responses
   - ✅ Dynamic timeout handling for reasoning-enabled queries

4. **MCP Planner Graph Integration** (`src/api/graphs/mcp_integrated_planner_graph.py`)

   - ✅ Passes reasoning parameters to all agents
   - ✅ Extracts reasoning chains from agent responses
   - ✅ Includes reasoning in context for response synthesis

5. **All Agent Integrations** (Phase 1 Complete)

   - ✅ UI toggle to enable/disable reasoning
   - ✅ Reasoning type selection
   - ✅ Reasoning chain visualization in chat messages

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete

All agents now support:
- `enable_reasoning` parameter in `process_query()`
- Automatic complex query detection via `_is_complex_query()`
- Reasoning type selection via `_determine_reasoning_types()`
- Reasoning chain included in agent responses
- Graceful fallback when reasoning is disabled or fails

## Reasoning Types Implemented

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (`CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT`)

**Purpose**: Step-by-step thinking process with clear reasoning steps

**Implementation**:
- Breaks down queries into 5 analysis steps:
  1. What is the user asking for?
  2. What information do I need to answer this?
  3. What are the key entities and relationships?
  4. What are the potential approaches to solve this?
  5. What are the constraints and considerations?

**Code Location**: `reasoning_engine.py:234-304`

**Usage**: Always included in all agents for complex queries when reasoning is enabled

### 2. Multi-Hop Reasoning (`MULTI_HOP`)

**Purpose**: Connect information across different data sources

**Implementation**:
- Step 1: Identify information needs from multiple sources
- Step 2: Gather data from equipment, workforce, safety, and inventory
- Step 3: Connect information across sources to answer query

**Code Location**: `reasoning_engine.py:306-425`

**Data Sources**:
- Equipment status and telemetry
- Workforce and task data
- Safety incidents and procedures
- Inventory and stock levels

### 3. Scenario Analysis (`SCENARIO_ANALYSIS`)

**Purpose**: What-if reasoning and alternative scenario analysis

**Implementation**:
- Analyzes 5 scenarios:
  1. Best case scenario
  2. Worst case scenario
  3. Most likely scenario
  4. Alternative approaches
  5. Risk factors and mitigation

**Code Location**: `reasoning_engine.py:427-530`

**Use Cases**: Planning, risk assessment, decision support

### 4. Causal Reasoning (`CAUSAL`)

**Purpose**: Cause-and-effect analysis and relationship identification

**Implementation**:
- Step 1: Identify potential causes and effects
- Step 2: Analyze causal strength and evidence
- Evaluates direct and indirect causal relationships

**Code Location**: `reasoning_engine.py:532-623`

**Use Cases**: Root cause analysis, incident investigation

### 5. Pattern Recognition (`PATTERN_RECOGNITION`)

**Purpose**: Learn from query patterns and user behavior

**Implementation**:
- Step 1: Analyze current query patterns
- Step 2: Learn from historical patterns (last 10 queries)
- Step 3: Generate insights and recommendations

**Code Location**: `reasoning_engine.py:625-742`

**Features**:
- Query pattern tracking
- User behavior analysis
- Historical pattern learning
- Insight generation

## How It Works

### Agent Integration Pattern

All agents follow the same pattern for reasoning integration:

```python
# In any agent's process_query() method (e.g., mcp_equipment_agent.py)

# Step 1: Check if reasoning should be enabled
if enable_reasoning and self.reasoning_engine and self._is_complex_query(query):
    # Step 2: Determine reasoning types based on query content
    reasoning_types = self._determine_reasoning_types(query, context)
    
    # Step 3: Process with reasoning
    reasoning_chain = await self.reasoning_engine.process_with_reasoning(
        query=query,
        context=context or {},
        reasoning_types=reasoning_types,
        session_id=session_id,
    )
    
    # Step 4: Use reasoning chain in response generation
    response = await self._generate_response_with_tools(
        query, tool_results, session_id, reasoning_chain=reasoning_chain
    )
```

### Chat Router Integration

The main chat router (`src/api/routers/chat.py`) supports reasoning:

```python
# Chat request includes reasoning parameters
@router.post("/chat")
async def chat(req: ChatRequest):
    # req.enable_reasoning: bool = False
    # req.reasoning_types: Optional[List[str]] = None
    
    # Pass to MCP planner graph
    result = await mcp_planner_graph.process(
        message=req.message,
        enable_reasoning=req.enable_reasoning,
        reasoning_types=req.reasoning_types,
        ...
    )
    
    # Extract reasoning chain from result
    reasoning_chain = result.get("reasoning_chain")
    reasoning_steps = result.get("reasoning_steps")
    
    # Include in response
    return ChatResponse(
        ...,
        reasoning_chain=reasoning_chain,
        reasoning_steps=reasoning_steps
    )
```

### Complex Query Detection

All agents use `_is_complex_query()` to determine if reasoning should be enabled:

**Complex Query Indicators**:
- Keywords: "analyze", "compare", "relationship", "scenario", "what if", "cause", "effect", "pattern", "trend", "explain", "investigate", etc.
- Query length and structure
- Context complexity

### Reasoning Type Selection

Each agent automatically selects reasoning types based on query content and agent-specific logic:

- **Always**: Chain-of-Thought (for all complex queries)
- **Multi-Hop**: If query contains "analyze", "compare", "relationship", "connection", "across", "multiple"
- **Scenario Analysis**: If query contains "what if", "scenario", "alternative", "option", "plan", "strategy"
  - **Operations Agent**: Always includes scenario analysis for workflow optimization queries
  - **Forecasting Agent**: Always includes scenario analysis + pattern recognition for forecasting queries
- **Causal**: If query contains "cause", "effect", "because", "result", "consequence", "due to", "leads to"
  - **Safety Agent**: Always includes causal reasoning for safety queries
  - **Document Agent**: Uses causal reasoning for quality analysis
- **Pattern Recognition**: If query contains "pattern", "trend", "learn", "insight", "recommendation", "optimize", "improve"
  - **Forecasting Agent**: Always includes pattern recognition for forecasting queries

## API Usage
