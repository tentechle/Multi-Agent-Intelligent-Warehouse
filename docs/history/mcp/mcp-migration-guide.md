## Migration Overview

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for tool discovery, execution, and communication between AI agents and external systems. It provides:

- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Automatic discovery of available tools and capabilities
- **Standardized Communication**: Consistent interface for tool execution
- **Service Registry**: Centralized management of services and adapters
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new tools and services

### Migration Benefits

- **Improved Tool Management**: Centralized tool discovery and execution
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Easy addition of new adapters and tools
- **Better Monitoring**: Comprehensive health monitoring and alerting
- **Standardized Interface**: Consistent API across all services
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplified agent-to-tool communication

### Migration Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Status |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| Phase 1 | 2-3 weeks | Foundation & Infrastructure |  Complete |
| Phase 2 | 2-3 weeks | Agent Integration |  Complete |
| Phase 3 | 3-4 weeks | Full Migration |  In Progress |

## Phase 1: MCP Foundation

### Objectives

- Implement core MCP server and client infrastructure
- Create MCP-enabled base classes for adapters and tools
- Migrate ERP adapter as proof of concept

### Components Implemented

#### 1. MCP Server (`src/api/services/mcp/server.py`)

The MCP server provides tool registration, discovery, and execution capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- Tool registration and management
- Tool discovery and listing
- Tool execution with parameter validation
- Resource and prompt management
- Error handling and logging

**Usage Example:**
```python
from src.api.services.mcp.server import MCPServer, MCPTool, MCPToolType

# Create server
server = MCPServer()

# Register a tool
tool = MCPTool(
    name="get_inventory",
    description="Get inventory levels",
    tool_type=MCPToolType.FUNCTION,
    parameters={
        "item_id": {"type": "string", "required": True},
        "location": {"type": "string", "required": False}
    },
    handler=inventory_handler
)

server.register_tool(tool)

# Start server
await server.start()
```

#### 2. MCP Client (`src/api/services/mcp/client.py`)

The MCP client enables communication with MCP servers and tool execution.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-server communication
- Tool discovery and execution
- Resource access and management
- Prompt management
- HTTP and WebSocket support

**Usage Example:**
```python
from src.api.services.mcp.client import MCPClient, MCPConnectionType

# Create client
client = MCPClient()

# Connect to server
await client.connect("http://localhost:8000", MCPConnectionType.HTTP)

# Discover tools
tools = await client.discover_tools()

# Execute tool
result = await client.execute_tool("get_inventory", {
    "item_id": "ITEM001",
    "location": "WAREHOUSE_A"
})
```

#### 3. Base Classes (`src/api/services/mcp/base.py`)

Base classes provide the foundation for MCP adapters and tools.

**Key Components:**

**Usage Example:**
```python
from src.api.services.mcp.base import MCPAdapter, AdapterConfig, AdapterType

class MyAdapter(MCPAdapter):
    def __init__(self, config: AdapterConfig):
        super().__init__(config)
        self._setup_tools()
    
    def _setup_tools(self):
        # Setup adapter-specific tools
        pass
    
    async def connect(self) -> bool:
        # Implement connection logic
        pass
    
    async def disconnect(self) -> None:
        # Implement disconnection logic
        pass
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Tool Discovery Failures

**Problem:** Tools not being discovered automatically.

**Solution:**
```python
# Check discovery service status
status = await discovery.get_discovery_status()
print(f"Discovery running: {status['running']}")
print(f"Sources: {status['sources']}")

# Manually register source
await discovery.register_discovery_source(
    "my_adapter",
    my_adapter,
    "mcp_adapter"
)
```

#### 2. Tool Execution Errors

**Problem:** Tools failing to execute.

**Solution:**
```python
# Validate tool execution
validation_result = await validation.validate_tool_execution(
    tool_id="my_tool",
    arguments={"param1": "value1"},
    context=execution_context
)

if not validation_result.is_valid:
    print(f"Validation errors: {validation_result.errors}")
```

#### 3. Service Registration Issues

**Problem:** Services not registering properly.

**Solution:**
```python
# Check service registry
services = await registry.get_all_services()
print(f"Registered services: {len(services)}")

# Check service health
for service in services:
    health = await registry.get_service_health(service.service_id)
    print(f"Service {service.service_name}: {health.is_healthy}")
```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Logging:**
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger("src.api.services.mcp").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

2. **Check Service Status:**
```python
# Get monitoring dashboard
dashboard = await monitoring.get_monitoring_dashboard()
print(json.dumps(dashboard, indent=2))
```

3. **Validate Configuration:**
```python
# Check adapter configuration
config = adapter.config
print(f"Adapter type: {config.adapter_type}")
print(f"Connection string: {config.connection_string}")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Tool Design
