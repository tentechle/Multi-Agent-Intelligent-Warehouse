# API Migration Plan — Phase 9B


> **Historical document**
>
> This file reflects an earlier MAIW implementation phase and may not describe the current MAIW v2 architecture. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and the project [README](../../README.md) for the current authoritative design.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (Phase 9B)  
**Branch:** `feat/phase-9b-api-migration`  
**Entering baseline:** 528 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed (CORE CI)

## Objective

Move the application shell from `src/api/` to `apps/api/maiw_api/` so that
`apps/api` becomes the canonical FastAPI entrypoint and `MAIWRuntime` becomes
the canonical composition root.

Canonical packages (`maiw-models`, `maiw-mcp`, `maiw-state`, `maiw-skills`,
`maiw-decision`, `maiw-execution`, `maiw-agents`) must not depend on the API
layer. The API layer may depend on all of them.

### `src/api/services/` — classification

| Module | Classification | Remove When |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| `model_gateway/__init__.py` | COMPATIBILITY SHIM → `maiw_models` | After all callers migrated to `maiw_models` |
| `model_gateway/*.py` | ACTIVE — original implementation (now in `maiw-models`) | Already shadowed by canonical package |

| `skills/equipment.py` | COMPATIBILITY SHIM → `maiw_skills` | After callers migrated |
| `skills/labor.py` | COMPATIBILITY SHIM → `maiw_skills` | After callers migrated |

## Compatibility Shim Removal Gate

Shims are removed when **all** of the following are true:

1. Zero production router imports the shim path
2. Zero maintained test files import the shim path
3. The new canonical path is exercised by CORE CI

### Shim status at end of Phase 9B

| Shim | Remaining callers | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|
| `src.api.services.model_gateway` | Legacy src agents (not on canonical path) | REMOVE — legacy agents are no longer on production call path after new app is active |
| `src.api.skills.*` | Legacy src agents | REMOVE — same reason |

---

## MCP Legacy Status

`src/api/services/mcp/` — 13 files (not counting `__init__.py`).

Remaining callers after Phase 9B:
- `src/api/routers/mcp.py` → **REPLACED** by `maiw_api.routers.mcp_status`
- `src/api/graphs/mcp_*.py` → KEEP TEMPORARILY (LangGraph graphs used by chat router)
- `src/api/services/evidence/evidence_collector.py` → DEPRECATE
- `src/api/agents/*/mcp_*.py` → DEPRECATED stubs

After Phase 9B, `src/api/services/mcp/` callers are isolated to legacy graphs and
deprecated agent stubs. The new canonical `apps/api` app never imports from it.

---

## Forecasting Status

`INTEGRATION-SPECIFIC`. `integrations/forecasting/` and
`src/api/agents/forecasting/` remain as-is. The forecasting router is imported
into the new app from `src.api.routers.advanced_forecasting` during Phase 9B.
The forecasting integration does not use the `STATE → DECIDE → EXECUTE` pipeline.

**FORECASTING LEGACY INTEGRATION BOUNDARY:** The forecasting router pulls
`src.api.agents.forecasting.forecasting_agent` which imports
`src.api.services.model_gateway` (the shim). This is tolerated in Phase 9B
since forecasting remains on the legacy call path.

---

## Document Status

`KEEP TEMPORARILY — DOCUMENT INTEGRATION`. The document pipeline depends on
`asyncpg`, `pymilvus`, OCR libraries, and NeMo services. It is imported into the
new app from `src.api.routers.document` and remains isolated behind the legacy
call path. It is not part of Phase 9B scope.

---

## Docker / Deployment Impact

- Dockerfile updated to: `pip install -e apps/api`
- Entrypoint updated to: `uvicorn maiw_api.app:app`
- PYTHONPATH includes `/app` (same as before)
- All 7 canonical packages remain installed

---

## Test Strategy Update

Phase 9B adds `tests/api/` as a new test tier. These tests:
- Create the app without infrastructure
- Verify route registration
- Verify MAIWRuntime construction with mocks
- Verify package dependency direction

`tests/api/` is included in CORE CI if it is deterministic and
infrastructure-free. See `TEST_STRATEGY.md` for the updated canonical command.
