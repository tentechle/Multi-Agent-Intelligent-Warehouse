"""
DecisionEngine data models.

DecisionOutcome
---------------
The four possible outcomes of a decision evaluation.  The engine never
"executes" an action — it only classifies the proposal.

ConstraintViolation
-------------------
A single rule that was violated.  Multiple violations may exist per
evaluation; all are included in the DecisionResult.

DecisionRequest
---------------
Input to the DecisionEngine: an ActionProposal paired with a
WarehouseStateSnapshot.  The snapshot is required so that the engine
always evaluates against a consistent, timestamped view of reality.

DecisionResult
--------------
Output of the DecisionEngine evaluation.  Immutable; assigned a UUID at
creation time for audit linkage.

        One or more hard constraints were violated.  The action must not

        must review and approve before execution.
