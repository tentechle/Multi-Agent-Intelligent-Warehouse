Canonical MAIW agent assessment contracts.

OperationalAssessment is the structured output of an agent that has observed
warehouse state and produced recommendations. It is NOT a demo contract.

Architecture
------------
  WarehouseStateSnapshot (sealed, immutable)
      ↓
  OperationsCoordinationAgent.analyze_disruption()
      ↓
  ModelGateway → LLM
      ↓
  OperationalAssessment  (LLM recommends via RecommendedAction)
      ↓
  Proposal builders (construct ActionProposal from RecommendedAction)
      ↓
  DecisionEngine → ActionExecutor → MCP write

Invariants
----------
- LLM populates RecommendedAction fields; it never constructs ActionProposal or MCP params.
- RecommendedAction.capability is a semantic name, not an MCP tool name.
- All fields are optional except domain, capability, target, objective, rationale, priority.

    A single operational recommendation produced by the LLM.

    that is the responsibility of the canonical proposal builders.

    Fields
    ------
    domain:
        Operational domain: equipment | labor | wave | inventory.
    capability:
        Semantic capability name (matches MCP tool name but is not a call).
    target:
        The primary entity to act on: asset_id, task_id, zone, or wave_id.
    objective:
        Plain-English description of the intended outcome.
    rationale:
        Why this action is needed — derived from observed facts.
    priority:
        Urgency of this recommendation.
    subtype:
        Optional hint for proposal builders (e.g. 'emergency' for maintenance).

class OperationalAssessment(BaseModel):
    """
    Structured output of OperationsCoordinationAgent.analyze_disruption().

    One assessment per analyze_disruption() call. All fields are populated
    by the agent — never by calling code or the LLM response parser directly.

    Fields
    ------
    trace_id:
        Correlation ID propagated through State → Model → Proposal → Decision
        → Execution → SSE. Set by the caller of analyze_disruption().
    snapshot_id:
        UUID of the WarehouseStateSnapshot that was analyzed.
    warehouse_id:
        Warehouse the snapshot belongs to.
    assessed_at:
        UTC timestamp when the assessment was produced.
    summary:
        One or two sentences describing the situation (no chain-of-thought).
    severity:
        Overall severity of the observed disruption.
    domains_affected:
        Which operational domains are involved.
    facts_observed:
        Key factual observations extracted from the snapshot (not LLM reasoning).
    skills_consulted:
        Semantic capability names read during state assembly.
    recommendations:
        Ordered list of recommended actions (most urgent first).
    model_id:
        Model that produced the assessment (from ModelResponse).
    routing_rule:
        Routing rule that selected the model (from ModelRouteDecision).
    routing_reason:
        Human-readable routing rationale.
    latency_ms:
        End-to-end model call latency.
