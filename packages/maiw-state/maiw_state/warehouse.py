WarehouseState and WarehouseStateSnapshot.

WarehouseState
--------------
The operational context for one warehouse at a point in time.  Agents
receive a WarehouseState (or snapshot) before reasoning rather than
querying backends directly.  Only domains explicitly requested by the
agent are populated — absent fields are ``None``.

WarehouseStateSnapshot
----------------------
An immutable, identified snapshot of WarehouseState used by the
DecisionEngine.  Each snapshot has a UUID so that:

    1. Decisions reference a known, stable version of state.
    2. Audit records can reference the exact state that drove a decision.
    3. The DecisionEngine never operates against mutable shared state.

Extension points
----------------
Additional domains (waves, labor, orders, docks) are represented as
``None`` fields with ``# future`` comments.  Adding a domain requires:

    1. A new model in ``maiw_state/models/<domain>.py``
    2. A field in ``WarehouseState``
    3. A population step in ``WarehouseStateProvider``
    4. A ``StateRequirements`` flag
