Equipment skills — the operational bridge between agents and MCP v2.

Read skills (no side effects):
    EquipmentStatusSkill      — warehouse.equipment.get_status  (read)
    EquipmentTelemetrySkill   — warehouse.equipment.get_telemetry (read)

Proposal skills (build ActionProposal locally, no MCP call):
    EquipmentAssignmentSkill  — builds ActionProposal.for_equipment_assign() in-process

Execution skills (called only after DecisionEngine APPROVED):
    ExecuteEquipmentAssignmentSkill  — warehouse.equipment.assign
    ExecuteEquipmentReleaseSkill     — warehouse.equipment.release
    ExecuteEquipmentMaintenanceSkill — warehouse.equipment.schedule_maintenance

Architecture invariant
----------------------
Proposal skills NEVER call MCP.  They construct ActionProposal objects locally
and return them to the agent layer for forwarding to DecisionEngine.  Only
execution skills reach MCP write capabilities, and only after EquipmentActionExecutor
has verified a bound APPROVED DecisionResult.
