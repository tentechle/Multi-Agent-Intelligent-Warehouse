maiw-execution — shared execution boundary primitives.

Phase 10E Batch 1: canonical ExecutionOutcome, ExecutionRegistry integration,
trace propagation, and execution_id survival through the write path.

Architecture rule
-----------------
The ONLY path from an agent to a write capability is:

    ActionProposal
        ↓
    DecisionEngine.evaluate()  →  APPROVED
        ↓
    BaseActionExecutor.execute()  (guards 1-5)
        ↓
    _do_execute()  (domain-specific skill call)
        ↓
    MCP write capability

Guard lifecycle (enforced in execute() before any write):
    1. APPROVED gate          — decision.outcome must be APPROVED
    2. Proposal/decision bind — decision.proposal_id == proposal.proposal_id
    3. Action allowlist       — proposal.action in _ALLOWED_ACTIONS frozenset
    4. Staleness check        — decision age <= max_decision_age_seconds
    5. Additional guards hook — subclass override (_check_additional_guards)

Execution outcomes (Phase 10E)
------------------------------
    EXECUTED  — provider confirmed mutation occurred
    NO_OP     — desired state already existed; no mutation required
    DEFERRED  — valid request, cannot execute now
    CONFLICT  — current warehouse state prevents this action
    UNKNOWN   — mutation may have occurred; response was lost (AmbiguousWriteError)
    FAILED    — no mutation occurred; provider rejected or was unreachable

Identity chain
--------------
    trace_id        — full request lifecycle correlation
    proposal_id     — the proposed warehouse change
    decision_id     — the authority evaluation
    execution_id    — this logical execution attempt (generated before write,
                      propagated through MCP to the provider)
    idempotency_key — identity of the intended logical mutation (caller-supplied)
    provider_reference — backend-specific transaction/allocation reference
