Phase 10E Batch 3 — UNKNOWN resolution via state-based reconciliation.

ReconciliationOutcome answers:
    "What did MAIW subsequently establish about that uncertain write?"

ExecutionOutcome answers:
    "What did the write attempt itself report?"

These are distinct and both are preserved. ExecutionOutcome.UNKNOWN is NEVER
rewritten to EXECUTED after reconciliation — the original write history is immutable.
ReconciliationRecord is stored alongside the original ExecutionRecord.

Identity binding: reconciliation operates on the original execution_id, proposal_id,
decision_id, and approval_id. It resolves uncertainty about an EXISTING execution.
No new proposal, decision, or approval is created.

Architecture invariant: ReconciliationStrategy.read_current_state() must read
authoritative state through canonical MCP read skills. DemoWarehouseWorld and
provider internals must never be consulted directly.

SINGLE-PROCESS SAFETY: ReconciliationService is stateless. All persistence is
in ExecutionRegistry which is already labeled single-process.
