"""
Deterministic model routing policy.

The router selects a Nemotron model role given a ModelRequest.
It does not perform ML-based routing — policy is explicit and auditable.

Routing decisions are always recorded in the ModelRouteDecision and
surfaced in ModelResponse so that every selection is observable.

Routing rules (priority order):
  1. multimodal_input     — non-TEXT modality → nano-omni
  2. judge_task           — task name contains judge/eval keywords → ultra
  3. critical_risk        — risk_level=CRITICAL → super (minimum)
  4. high_reasoning       — reasoning=HIGH → super
  5. medium_reasoning     — reasoning=MEDIUM → nano
  6. low_reasoning        — reasoning=LOW → lightning

Fallback chain (when preferred role is disabled):
  lightning → nano → super
  nano → super
  super → (none; ModelUnavailable raised)
  ultra → super
  nano-omni → super (degrades to text-only)

Telemetry fields:
  requested_role  — ideal role from routing policy before fallbacks
  selected_role   — role that actually serves the request
  routing_rule    — machine-readable rule name (e.g. "medium_reasoning")
  routing_reason  — human-readable description of why requested_role was chosen
  fallback_from   — set when selected_role != requested_role
  fallback_reason — why the preferred role was unavailable
