"""
Phase 18B: RoutingStrategy protocol + PolicyFilter.

Separates candidate eligibility (policy) from model ranking (routing strategy).

Conceptual flow:
    ALL REGISTERED MODELS
            ↓
    POLICY FILTER (PolicyFilter.filter)
            ↓
    ELIGIBLE CANDIDATES
            ↓
    ROUTING STRATEGY (ModelRouter / RuleBasedRoutingStrategy)
            ↓
    SELECTED MODEL

Policy decides what is allowed.
Routing strategy chooses among the allowed candidates.

Current architecture keeps ModelRouter as the single authority. This module
makes the policy/routing distinction explicit without restructuring ModelRouter.

RoutingStrategy is a typed Protocol — any class with a compatible ``select``
method satisfies it without inheritance. The deterministic ModelRouter is the
default and only production implementation.

This module is ADDITIVE — it does not change ModelRouter or ModelGateway behaviour.
