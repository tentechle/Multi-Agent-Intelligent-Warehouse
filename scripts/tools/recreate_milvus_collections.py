"""
Drop and recreate Milvus vector collections for embedding dimension migration.

Use this after switching the embedding model (e.g. from 1024-d to 2048-d).
Drops: warehouse_documents, warehouse_docs, warehouse_docs_gpu.
Collections are recreated automatically on next backend start or first use.
Re-index by re-uploading or re-processing documents through the document pipeline.

Usage (from project root):
  python scripts/tools/recreate_milvus_collections.py
  # or with venv:
  . env/bin/activate && python scripts/tools/recreate_milvus_collections.py
