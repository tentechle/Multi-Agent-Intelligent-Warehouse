## 📊 Data Generation Scripts

Located in `scripts/data/` - Generate realistic warehouse data for demos and testing.

### Quick Demo Data Generator

**Script:** `scripts/data/run_quick_demo.sh`  
**Python:** `scripts/data/quick_demo_data.py`

Generates a minimal dataset for quick demos:
- 12 users across all roles
- 25 inventory items (including low stock alerts)
- 8 tasks with various statuses
- 8 safety incidents with different severities
- 7 days of equipment telemetry data
- 50 audit log entries

**Usage:**
```bash
cd scripts/data
./run_quick_demo.sh
```

### Full Synthetic Data Generator

**Script:** `scripts/data/run_data_generation.sh`  
**Python:** `scripts/data/generate_synthetic_data.py`

Generates comprehensive warehouse simulation data:
- 50 users across all roles
- 1,000 inventory items with realistic locations
- 500 tasks with various statuses and realistic payloads
- 100 safety incidents with different severities and types
- 30 days of equipment telemetry data (50 pieces of equipment)
- 200 audit log entries for user actions
- 1,000 vector embeddings for knowledge base
- Redis cache data for sessions and metrics

**Usage:**
```bash
cd scripts/data
./run_data_generation.sh
```

### Historical Demand Data Generator (Required for Forecasting)

**Script:** `scripts/data/generate_historical_demand.py`

**⚠️ Important:** This script is **separate** from the demo/synthetic data generators and is **required** for the forecasting system to work. It generates historical inventory movement data that forecasting models need to make predictions.

**What it generates:**
- Historical `inventory_movements` data (180 days by default)
- Outbound movements (demand/consumption) with realistic patterns
- Inbound movements (restocking) 
- Adjustments (inventory corrections)
- Seasonal patterns, promotional spikes, and brand-specific demand characteristics
- Frito-Lay product-specific demand profiles

**Why it's separate:**
- Forecasting requires extensive historical data (180+ days)
- Uses sophisticated demand modeling (seasonality, promotions, brand profiles)
- Can be run independently after initial data setup
- Not needed for basic demo/testing (only for forecasting features)

**Usage:**
```bash
cd scripts/data
source ../../env/bin/activate
export $(grep -E "^POSTGRES_" ../../.env | xargs)
python generate_historical_demand.py
```

**When to run:**
- After running `quick_demo_data.py` or `generate_synthetic_data.py`
- Before using the Forecasting page in the UI
- When you need to test forecasting features
- When historical demand data is missing or needs regeneration

**Output:**
- ~7,000+ inventory movements across all SKUs
- 180 days of historical demand patterns
- Brand-specific demand characteristics (Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, etc.)

### Additional Data Generators

- **`generate_equipment_telemetry.py`** - Generate equipment telemetry time-series data
- **`generate_all_sku_forecasts.py`** - Generate forecasts for all SKUs

### Database Coverage

- **PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB**: All structured data including inventory, tasks, users, safety incidents, equipment telemetry, audit logs, and **inventory_movements** (historical demand data)
- **Milvus**: Vector embeddings for knowledge base and document search
- **Redis**: Session data, cache data, and real-time metrics

**Note:** The `inventory_movements` table is only populated by `generate_historical_demand.py` and is required for forecasting features.

- **Time Range**: 180 days of historical data by default
- **Demand Patterns**: Seasonal variations, promotional spikes, weekend effects, brand-specific characteristics
- **Usage**: Required for forecasting system to generate demand predictions

## 🤖 Forecasting Scripts

Located in `scripts/forecasting/` - Demand forecasting and ML model training.

**⚠️ Prerequisites:** Before running forecasting scripts, ensure you have generated historical demand data using `scripts/data/generate_historical_demand.py`. The forecasting system requires historical `inventory_movements` data to generate predictions.

### Phase 1 & 2 Forecasting

Basic forecasting models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression, SVR, Linear Regression).

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/forecasting/phase1_phase2_forecasting_agent.py
```

### Phase 3 Advanced Forecasting

**Script:** `scripts/forecasting/phase3_advanced_forecasting.py`

Advanced forecasting with model performance tracking and database integration.

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/forecasting/phase3_advanced_forecasting.py
```

### RAPIDS GPU-Accelerated Forecasting
