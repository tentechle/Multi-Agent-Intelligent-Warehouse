Warehouse Operational Assistant - Planner/Router Graph
Based on NVIDIA AI Blueprint patterns for multi-agent orchestration.

This module implements the main planner/router agent that:
1. Analyzes user intents
2. Routes to appropriate specialized agents
3. Coordinates multi-agent workflows
4. Synthesizes responses from multiple agents
